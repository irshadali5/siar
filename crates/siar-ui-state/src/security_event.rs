//! Security Events Screen (ui-ux-15 §40-47), reconciling and widening
//! the simpler model this module previously held (which implemented
//! Part 28 §42, "Identity Change UX", specifically).
//!
//! **What changed and why**: the previous version of this module had
//! a 3-variant `SecurityEventKind` (`NewDeviceLinked`, `DeviceRevoked`,
//! `RootIdentityChanged`) and a 2-tier `SecurityEventSeverity`
//! (`Notice`/`StrongWarning`) — accurate to Part 28 §42's own text, but
//! narrower than this spec's own §41/§42, which define an 11-kind,
//! fieldless `SecurityEventKind` and a 3-tier `Info`/`Warning`/
//! `Critical` severity. Those are two different specs' models that
//! happened to share a name; a previous round's roadmap entry noted
//! this section as "already covered," which undersold the gap — this
//! is the correction, widening the existing type in place (same
//! module, same exported names where they still apply) rather than
//! adding a second, parallel type.
//!
//! §41's `SecurityEventKind` is fieldless in the spec's own sketch —
//! `related_device`/`related_contact` live on `SecurityEvent` itself
//! (§40), not embedded per-variant. Only 3 of the 11 kinds have a real
//! backend signal anywhere in this workspace today (device linked,
//! device revoked, identity changed); the other 8
//! (`DeviceLinkDenied`, `VerificationFailed`, `RecoveryConfigured`,
//! `RecoveryChanged`, `BackupFailed`, `KeyRotation`,
//! `SuspiciousAuthorization`, `SecurityPolicyChanged`) are included
//! because §41 defines them as part of the type's own literal shape —
//! same precedent as `trust.rs`'s `TrustSource` (Part 28 §41, a
//! different §41) — not because anything can construct them yet. A
//! caller trying to raise one of the 8 unbacked kinds today has no
//! wired path to do so; that's an honest gap, not a claim of hidden
//! functionality.
//!
//! §47: "Rust owns resolved state. UI can perform actions then event
//! becomes resolved." `resolved` is therefore the one state field this
//! module tracks — no separate "acknowledged" concept layered on top
//! (the previous version had one; dropped here as redundant now that
//! `resolved` exists and is the spec's own literal model).
