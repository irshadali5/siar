//! `AppCommand`/`AppEvent` (plan.md §54): the boundary between the UI and
//! the messaging core. UI components only ever construct `AppCommand`s
//! and react to `AppEvent`s — never call `MessageService` methods
//! directly, which is what keeps `siar-messaging`/`siar-transport` out of
//! `apps/desktop`'s component code (plan.md §86).
//!
//! Scoped to what's actually implemented through Phase 3 — plan.md §54's
//! fuller list (`AddContact`, `DownloadAttachment`, `StartCall`, ...)
//! grows this enum as those features land, not before; an unused variant
//! that nothing can act on yet is just dead weight in the match arms.
