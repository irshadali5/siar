//! next.md §29's `MeshEnvelope` — the routing-header wrapper Phase 7 of
//! the next.md rebuild found missing, and the reason
//! `apps/emergency-node` could log an unrecognized peer's frame but
//! couldn't do anything useful with it.
//!
//! [`v1::Envelope`] (this module's sibling) needs a live session —
//! pre-shared X25519 keys from a `PeerTicket` — before
//! `MessageService::handle_incoming` can decrypt anything at all. A
//! relay/DTN node forwarding for a stranger it's never been introduced
//! to can't meet that requirement, and per next.md §74 it shouldn't
//! need to: "a completely unknown phone may be trusted to carry
//! ciphertext... without being trusted to read messages."
//!
//! [`MeshEnvelope`] is the fix: `ciphertext` is typically an already-
//! encoded `WireMessage::V1` from a real session between the *original*
//! sender and the *real* destination — this module never looks inside
//! it, same "never looks inside `payload`" rule `v1::Envelope` already
//! documents for itself. A relay only ever needs `destination` (to
//! decide whether/where to forward) and `hop_limit`/`expires_at` (to
//! decide whether to bother at all) — it never needs a session, and
//! never gets one.
