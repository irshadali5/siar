//! next.md §76–77's mailbox check-in — a device explicitly identifying
//! *itself* to a relay and asking "what do you have for me," distinct
//! from `mesh.rs`'s `MeshEnvelope` routing.
//!
//! ## Why this is a different message, not a `Mesh` variant
//!
//! `apps/emergency-node`'s existing forward-on-contact behavior offers
//! stored bundles to *whichever peer it happens to be talking to*,
//! learning nothing about who that peer is — `MeshEnvelope` deliberately
//! carries a `destination` but no sender identity (see that module's
//! own doc comment), because next.md §73–74's mesh-privacy sections are
//! explicit that an intermediate relay shouldn't learn more than it
//! needs to route. A `MailboxCheckIn` is the opposite kind of
//! disclosure: the device sending one is revealing *its own* identity,
//! by its own choice, specifically so a relay can answer "is anything
//! here addressed to you" — the same distinction next.md §32 draws
//! between "an intermediate carrying ciphertext for someone else" and
//! "the actual recipient identifying themselves to collect it."
//! Folding this into `MeshEnvelope` would have blurred that line rather
//! than just being a smaller diff.
//!
//! ## Authentication (added this pass) vs. what next.md §32 fully asks for
//!
//! A `MailboxCheckIn` now carries a self-asserted Ed25519 verifying key
//! and a signature over `(device, verifying_key, issued_at_millis)`,
//! verified with `siar_crypto::DeviceIdentity::verify` — the same
//! already-adopted primitive every signed message in this workspace
//! uses, not a new cryptographic scheme (this module's own earlier
//! version of this doc comment flagged custom cryptography as
//! something to avoid per architecture.md §106; standard signature
//! verification with an existing primitive isn't that). This closes
//! the plain claim this type used to be: without a valid signature
//! matching the claimed key, `MailboxCheckIn::verify` rejects it
//! outright, so an attacker without a device's private key can no
//! longer produce a check-in for it at all.
//!
//! [`DeviceKeyDirectory`] adds trust-on-first-use pinning on top of
//! that — the same well-understood pattern SSH host keys use, not a
//! bespoke scheme either: the first check-in seen for a `DeviceId`
//! establishes its key, and a later check-in claiming the same
//! `DeviceId` with a *different* key is rejected as a probable
//! impersonation attempt.
//!
//! What this still does NOT do, and next.md §32 explicitly asks for:
//! "Avoid stable public account IDs directly indexing mailbox messages.
//! Use rotating mailbox capabilities/tokens." `MailboxCheckIn::device`
//! is still a bare, stable `DeviceId` — this pass closes the
//! *authentication* half of §32 (is this really the device it claims
//! to be), not the *unlinkability* half. [`AnonymousMailboxCheckIn`]
//! (added a later pass, alongside [`siar_crypto::mailbox_token`]) is
//! that unlinkability half — a genuinely different, opt-in check-in
//! path a device uses instead of this one once it's paired with
//! whoever it expects mailbox contents from, not a replacement for
//! this identified path (see [`AnonymousMailboxCheckIn`]'s own doc
//! comment for why both still need to coexist, and exactly what
//! "closes the gap" means and doesn't mean here).
