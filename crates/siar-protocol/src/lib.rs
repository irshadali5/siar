//! siar-protocol: the wire format.
//!
//! Rule (plan.md §60): the wire protocol and the internal domain model are
//! two different things. `domain::MessageContent` never gets serialized
//! directly onto the network — it is converted into a versioned
//! `protocol::v1` type first, so `domain` can evolve freely and old
//! clients speaking `v1` keep working when `v2` ships.

/// Outer wire envelope. Every frame that goes on the QUIC stream is one of
/// these, `version`-tagged so the receiver knows how to decode `payload`
/// before it even looks at message content (plan.md §11, §60).
///
/// `Mesh` is next.md §29's addition (Phase 7's discovered gap, fixed in
/// the next pass): a relay can match on this variant and route by
/// `MeshEnvelope::destination` alone, without ever attempting the
/// session-decryption `V1` requires — see `mesh.rs`'s doc comment for
/// the full rationale.
///
/// `MailboxCheckIn` is next.md §76–77's addition — see `mailbox.rs`'s
/// doc comment for why this needed a genuinely new message rather than
/// a tweak to `Mesh`: a relay offering bundles to *anyone it happens to
/// talk to* (this workspace's existing naive-forward behavior) is a
/// different, privacy-cheaper thing than a relay answering "what do you
/// have for me specifically," which is what a device explicitly
/// identifying itself is asking.
///
/// `TokenMailboxDeposit`/`AnonymousMailboxCheckIn` (a later pass) are
/// the unlinkable counterparts to `Mesh`/`MailboxCheckIn` — see
/// `mailbox.rs`'s `TokenMailboxEnvelope`/`AnonymousMailboxCheckIn` doc
/// comments for why they're separate wire shapes rather than a
/// `destination` enum variant grafted onto the existing two.
///
/// `RouteAdvertisement` (a later pass still) is a different kind of
/// message entirely — not something addressed to a destination at all,
/// but a relay telling a directly-connected peer about a route it
/// knows. See `route_advertisement.rs`'s doc comment for the full
/// picture, including its deliberately-unauthenticated trust model.
