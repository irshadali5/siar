//! `MlsGroupSession`: the group lifecycle next.md §28 asks for, wrapped
//! around openmls. Every non-trivial call below has a directly
//! corresponding line in openmls's own `openmls/tests/book_code.rs`
//! (anchors named in each method's doc comment) — see this crate's
//! `lib.rs` doc comment for why that file specifically, and for what
//! this wrapper does not yet do (persistence, wiring into
//! `GroupService`).
//!
//! Two things this wrapper imposes that plain openmls doesn't, both
//! deliberate:
//!
//! 1. **Bytes in, bytes out.** Every openmls example in `book_code.rs`
//!    passes `MlsMessageOut`/`MlsMessageIn` around in-memory (it's test
//!    code — sender and receiver share a process). This wrapper always
//!    serializes to `Vec<u8>` at the boundary (`.to_bytes()` /
//!    `tls_deserialize_exact()`, both directly observed in
//!    `book_code.rs`'s `mls_message_in_from_bytes` anchor), because
//!    this workspace's sender and receiver are never the same process
//!    — the whole point is these bytes travel over `siar-transport`.
//! 2. **The adder merges its own commit immediately.** `book_code.rs`'s
//!    `alice_adds_bob` anchor is followed immediately (still inside the
//!    same anchor's surrounding code, not a separate anchor) by
//!    `alice_group.merge_pending_commit(alice_provider)` — i.e. openmls
//!    expects the caller to merge its own pending commit right after
//!    creating it, not wait for a round-trip. [`MlsGroupSession::add_member`]
//!    and [`MlsGroupSession::remove_member`] both do this internally so
//!    callers can't forget it.
