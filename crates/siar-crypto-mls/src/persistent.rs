//! Real disk persistence for MLS group state — closes the gap this
//! crate's own `lib.rs` doc comment has flagged since the first MLS
//! delivery: `OpenMlsRustCrypto`'s bundled storage
//! (`openmls_memory_storage::MemoryStorage`) is in-memory only, so a
//! process restart lost every group's live crypto state.
//!
//! ## A genuinely separate database, not a shared connection
//!
//! An earlier version of this crate's docs speculated about "deciding
//! how this composes with `siar-storage`'s own SQLite connection" —
//! that was **wrong**, caught while actually building this rather than
//! left uncorrected: `siar-storage` is backed by `stoolap`
//! (`crates/siar-storage/Cargo.toml`), not SQLite/`rusqlite` at all.
//! There is no existing SQLite connection to share. `SqlitePersistentProvider`
//! opens its own, separate SQLite file dedicated to MLS state. Two
//! embedded databases in one application is a real trade-off, not
//! ideal — but it's the honest one, not a "unify them" plan that was
//! never actually checked against what `siar-storage` runs on.
//!
//! ## What "real persistence" means here, precisely
//!
//! `openmls_sqlite_storage::SqliteStorageProvider` implements
//! `openmls_traits::storage::StorageProvider` — every signing key,
//! epoch secret, proposal, and piece of group state `MlsGroupSession`
//! touches now round-trips through SQLite instead of an in-memory
//! `HashMap`-equivalent. What this does NOT give you:
//!
//! - **No wiring into `GroupService` yet.** `GroupService`'s
//!   `mls_sessions`/`pending_identity` fields still use the default
//!   `MlsGroupSession`/`OpenMlsRustCrypto` (in-memory) — nothing
//!   currently constructs an `MlsGroupSession<SqlitePersistentProvider>`
//!   anywhere in `siar-messaging`. That's a real follow-up: deciding
//!   where the `.sqlite3` file lives on disk, how/whether one file
//!   holds every conversation's state or each gets its own, and how a
//!   restarting `GroupService` rediscovers which conversations have a
//!   persisted session to reopen — none of that is a `siar-crypto-mls`
//!   decision, it's an application-layer one, so it isn't made here.
//! - **No migration path for already-in-memory sessions.** A group
//!   created with `MlsGroupSession<OpenMlsRustCrypto>` (the default)
//!   can't be converted to a persistent one after the fact — nothing
//!   here attempts that.
//! - **No compiler-verified tests**, same caveat as this crate's other
//!   modules and for the same reason (see `lib.rs`'s top doc comment):
//!   correctness here rests on the openmls/rusqlite source checked
//!   below, not on having actually run.
