//! §39's own instruction — "Prefer explicit RAII permits... Dropping
//! permit releases accounting. This reduces leaks." — is the actual
//! design constraint this module exists to satisfy: a permit that
//! forgot to be released (an early return, a panic unwind, a bug) must
//! still give its capacity back automatically. That rules out a plain
//! "acquire, remember to call release()" API — this module never
//! offers one.

//! §41: "Same pattern" as §38-40's memory pool, applied to streams —
//! [`StreamLimiter`]/[`StreamPermit`] share an internal bounded-counter
//! primitive with [`BufferPool`]/[`MemoryPermit`] rather than
//! duplicating the same atomic compare-and-swap admission logic twice
//! under two names.
