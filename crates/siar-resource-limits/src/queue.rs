//! §17 "Bounded Queue Principle", §18 "Queue Categories", §19
//! "Priority Queues", §20 "Queue Capacity by Priority", §21

//!
//! [`BoundedPriorityQueue`] is deliberately *not* a fairness/dispatch
//! scheduler — that's already `siar_protocol_ext::scheduler::
//! FairScheduler`'s job (weighted round-robin dequeue order, built in
//! an earlier pass). This type answers a different question, the one
//! §17-20 are actually about: *can this item be admitted at all, right
//! now, given each priority tier's own reserved capacity* — §18's "each
//! [queue category] should have independent capacity" and §20's "Bulk
//! traffic must not consume capacity needed for receipts/SOS/control
//! frames." Six fully separate per-tier bounded queues (one `VecDeque`
//! each) make that structural rather than a policy a caller could
//! forget to apply: `Bulk` enqueues can never fill `Critical`'s slots
//! because they're not the same queue. A caller wanting weighted-fair
//! *dispatch order* across tiers feeds admitted items into a
//! `FairScheduler` next, the same layering
//! `siar_routing_policy::dispatch::RouteDispatchQueue` already
//! established (admission is one step, fairness is a separate later
//! step).
