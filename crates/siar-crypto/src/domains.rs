//! Key/domain separation registry (Part 28 §44).
//!
//! §44's own rule: "never interpret a signature from one domain as
//! valid in another." This module doesn't retrofit every existing
//! signing/AEAD call site in this workspace to use these constants —
//! several already have their own, independently-chosen domain strings
//! (`mailbox_token.rs`'s `ROOT_SECRET_DOMAIN`/`TOKEN_DOMAIN`,
//! `envelope.rs`'s `MessageType`-tagged AAD) that already achieve real
//! domain separation under different names; renaming those to match
//! this registry would be a wire-format-breaking change for zero
//! functional benefit, since the actual property §44 asks for — two
//! different purposes never sharing one domain string — already holds
//! for them. What this registry *does* provide: one canonical, typed
//! place for any *new* domain-separated construction in this crate (or
//! a sibling crate that mirrors the label string, since not everything
//! that needs a domain label depends on `siar-crypto` — see
//! `siar-blob-manifest::metadata_encryption`'s own doc comment) to draw
//! from, rather than each new module inventing its own ad hoc string.
//!
//! §44's own six domains are included verbatim
//! (`comm/msg/v1`...`comm/authority/v1`); `FileMetadata` is one this
//! crate needed and the spec's own list didn't name (§31's metadata
//! encryption is a distinct purpose from §29's file *content*
//! encryption, and reusing `comm/file/v1` for both would itself violate
//! §44's own rule) — added as an extension, not a deviation, following
//! the same `comm/<purpose>/v1` shape the other six use.
