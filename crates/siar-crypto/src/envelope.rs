//! Secure message envelope, associated data, and nonce derivation
//! (Part 28 §14, §15, §17).
//!
//! This deliberately does **not** build on `session.rs`'s `Session`
//! type. `Session` is Phase-1, static-ECDH-key AEAD with no per-message
//! counter state (see its own module doc) — there is nowhere in it to
//! hang a replay-safe counter or a deterministic nonce. Rather than bolt
//! that state onto a type this crate's own docs already say is getting
//! replaced by a real ratchet (§12/§13, still unbuilt), this module's
//! `encrypt_envelope`/`decrypt_envelope` take a raw per-message AEAD key
//! and an explicit `(epoch, counter)` directly — infrastructure a future
//! ratchet session can call into once it exists, without this envelope
//! layer needing to change shape.
//!
//! Nonce safety (§17: "do not create ad-hoc nonce schemes... use...
//! protocol state that guarantees safe nonce use") is met here by
//! deriving the nonce *deterministically* from `(epoch, counter)`
//! instead of drawing it from an RNG (the scheme `session.rs` uses
//! today). This is the same shape TLS 1.3 uses for its record nonces
//! (a sequence number folded into a fixed-width field) rather than a
//! novel construction: as long as a `(key, epoch, counter)` triple is
//! never reused — which is exactly what `replay.rs`'s `ReplayGuard`
//! exists to enforce on the receive side, and is the caller's
//! responsibility to guarantee on the send side by never reusing a
//! counter under the same epoch/key — the nonce can never repeat.
