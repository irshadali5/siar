//! Device revocation record and propagation mitigation (Part 28 §20,
//! §21).
//!
//! §20's revocation *mechanics* — "revoke DeviceId, rotate affected
//! security state, stop accepting new sessions" — are already real,
//! working code in `siar_identity_multidevice::revocation::revoke_device`
//! (that crate's own Part 02 §25-29). This module is deliberately not a
//! second implementation of that: it builds the one piece §20 asks for
//! that the directory-generation model doesn't produce — a standalone,
//! individually-signed `DeviceRevocation` record matching this spec's
//! own literal shape (`account`, `device`, `revoked_at`, `reason`,
//! `signature`) — as an artifact built *from* a real
//! `revoke_device`/`verify_revocation` outcome, not an alternative to
//! it. Where a `DeviceDirectory` update is the account's whole current
//! device-trust state, a `DeviceRevocation` is a single self-contained,
//! independently-verifiable fact ("this one device was revoked, at this
//! time, for this reason, and here's the signature proving the account's
//! root key said so") — useful anywhere a full directory snapshot would
//! be overkill: a gossip message, an audit log entry, an offline
//! signed file.
//!
//! §21 "Revocation Propagation" is honest about its own limits: "use
//! all available paths... a disconnected peer may not learn instantly."
//! The actual multi-path propagation (direct P2P / relay / DTN /
//! organization policy / offline signed file or QR) needs transport
//! infrastructure this crate doesn't have and isn't attempted here. What
//! *is* buildable now is §21's own suggested mitigation — "shorter-lived
//! device credentials or security epochs can reduce risk" — which this
//! module wires directly to §22's `SecurityEpoch`: producing a
//! `DeviceRevocation` always returns the account's next epoch alongside
//! it, and `is_epoch_stale_after_revocation` lets a caller decide
//! whether a message's `SecurityEpoch` (from `envelope.rs`) is recent
//! enough to trust without an explicit, confirmed revocation check —
//! not full propagation, but a real, checkable bound on exposure while
//! propagation is still in flight.
