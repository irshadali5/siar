//! Trust classification for emergency data — next.md §49–50, §97–98.
//!
//! This enum is the *result* a UI shows (next.md §97: "display Verified
//! / Known contact / Unverified clearly"), not the verification logic
//! itself. Producing an [`AlertTrust`] correctly needs real signature
//! checking against `siar-crypto` — an authority alert's signature
//! chaining to a configured authority key (§49), or a user report's
//! signature matching a known contact's account key (§50) — which this
//! crate deliberately doesn't have a dependency to do (see
//! `Cargo.toml`). What this module *can* pin down without any crypto
//! at all is the rule for what must NEVER produce
//! [`AlertTrust::VerifiedAuthority`]: next.md §49 in as many words —
//! "Never infer authenticity from `display_name = \"Police\"`." A
//! display name is user-controlled, arbitrary text; nothing in this
//! crate's types even has a field a caller could mistakenly wire up to
//! that check in the first place.
