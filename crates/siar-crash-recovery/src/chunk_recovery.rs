//! §18 "File Transfer Recovery", §19 "Chunk Commit Ordering", §20
//! "Chunk State Ambiguity".
//!
//! §19's own commit pipeline — write staging bytes → flush → verify
//! hash/auth → persist chunk-complete → ACK chunk — has more stages
//! than `siar_blob_manifest::resume::ResumeBitmap` tracks: that type
//! (already real, from an earlier pass of this workspace's Part 05
//! crate) is a binary received/not-received bitset, which is exactly
//! right for *what to request from a peer* but cannot represent §20's
//! actual hazard — "bytes were written but the completion bit was
//! never committed." A binary bitmap has no way to distinguish "safely
//! verified" from "written but never confirmed," so this module adds
//! the finer per-chunk state §19-20 need, as a genuine complement to
//! `ResumeBitmap` rather than a competing replacement for it: this
//! module answers "for a chunk marked received, is it actually safe to
//! trust," `ResumeBitmap` still answers "which chunks are missing at
//! all."
