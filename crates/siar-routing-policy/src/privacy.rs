//! §49 "Privacy Policy", §50 "Direct vs Relay Preference", §52 "Wi-Fi
//! Direct/Aware" threshold policy.
//!
//! §51 "LAN Preference", §53/§54 "Bluetooth Classic"/"Bluetooth LE",
//! §55 "Mesh Forwarding", §56 "DTN Routing Boundary" are read and
//! accounted for in this module's doc comments (below) rather than
//! each getting its own function — §51's preference already falls out
//! of [`crate::setup::static_setup_cost`] rating LAN [`crate::setup::SetupCost::Cheap`]
//! plus LAN's typical [`crate::types::RouteHealth::Healthy`] rating,
//! not a separately-weighted term; §53/§54's throughput distinction is
//! exactly [`crate::setup::static_setup_cost`]'s `BluetoothClassic`
//! (Expensive, pairing) vs `BluetoothLe` (Moderate, lighter GATT
//! connect) split plus whatever [`crate::types::PathCapabilities`]
//! flags a caller honestly sets per candidate — no *additional* hard
//! constraint is added here beyond [`eliminate_unjustified_expensive_setup`]
//! (which already covers `BluetoothClassic` alongside the Wi-Fi
//! variants); §56's three named routing-side questions ("DTN allowed?
//! priority? expiry? replication budget?") are now all real fields on
//! [`crate::requirements::DeliveryRequirements`]
//! (`allow_dtn`/`priority`/`expiry_millis`/`dtn_replication_budget`)
//! — nothing further to add here, and actual DTN peer-selection stays
//! out of scope per this crate's own top doc comment on Phase 5.
//!
//! §55 "Mesh Forwarding" is the one honest gap in this list: the spec
//! wants a mesh candidate to carry next-hop, estimated route utility,
//! hop budget, and relay trust policy as distinct fields, not just
//! compete as an ordinary [`crate::candidate::PathCandidate`] under
//! `TransportKind::MeshRelay`. That richer representation doesn't
//! exist yet — named here rather than forced into a shallow stand-in.
