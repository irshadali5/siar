//! §108 "Policy Layering" through §115 "Deferred Reasons".
//!
//! §108's own diagram —
//!
//! ```text
//! system hard safety policy
//!  ↓
//! application policy
//!  ↓
//! user preference
//!  ↓
//! operation requirements
//!  ↓
//! current network context
//! ```
//!
//! — describes an ORDER this crate's pieces have been calling in ad
//! hoc since round 2 (a caller composes
//! [`crate::security::eliminate_untrusted_candidates`], then
//! [`crate::privacy::eliminate_privacy_violations`], then
//! [`crate::scoring::eliminate_hard_constraint_violations`], then
//! [`crate::plan::plan_route`], roughly top-to-bottom already) but
//! never a single function that actually runs them in that order and
//! reports which layer, if any, was the one that left nothing
//! routable. That composition — not a sixth elimination mechanism —
//! is this module's job:
//!
//! - **system** (§109): [`SystemPolicy`] — the layer §108 says
//!   "cannot be overridden by UI preference." Its own two checkable
//!   examples are real code here: "never exceed hard size limit"
//!   ([`SystemPolicy::max_operation_bytes`] against
//!   [`crate::descriptor::OperationDescriptor::estimated_size`]) and
//!   "never route to revoked device"
//!   ([`crate::security::eliminate_untrusted_candidates`], already
//!   built for §48/§105 — reused, not reimplemented). §109's third
//!   example, "never send unencrypted private message," has no
//!   checkable equivalent here — this crate has no plaintext/
//!   ciphertext field to inspect in the first place (see
//!   [`crate::descriptor`]'s own doc comment on why), so it's a
//!   property of what a caller puts in a message, not something this
//!   layer can verify.
//! - **application** (§110): [`ApplicationPolicy`] — genuinely new.
//!   §110's own three examples split cleanly: "SOS may use DTN" and
//!   (implicitly) "normal messages may use relay" are already
//!   *operation*-level facts on
//!   [`crate::requirements::DeliveryRequirements`]
//!   (`allow_dtn`/`allow_relay`, §112 below), set per call by
//!   whichever constructor a caller uses — not something a
//!   fixed-at-the-application-layer type needs to duplicate. "Documents
//!   must not use unknown relay peers" is the one example with no
//!   existing home: an app-wide, not per-operation, relay ban —
//!   [`ApplicationPolicy::allow_relay`].
//! - **user** (§111): [`crate::privacy::PrivacyPolicy`] (unchanged) —
//!   already real since round 2. `avoid_metered` is §111's "no mobile
//!   data for files," `nearby_only` is "prefer local connections."
//!   "Disable Bluetooth relay" and "battery saver" have no field on
//!   `PrivacyPolicy` itself — the former isn't separately expressible
//!   from `avoid_relay`'s existing `IrohRelay`-only scope (an honest
//!   gap, not fixed this round to keep this round's own scope to
//!   §108-115 rather than reopening §49); the latter is
//!   [`crate::platform::DeviceState::battery_saver`], read directly by
//!   [`decide_route`] below rather than duplicated onto `PrivacyPolicy`.
//! - **operation** (§112): [`crate::requirements::DeliveryRequirements`]
//!   (unchanged) — already real. "Deadline" is
//!   `expiry_millis`/`max_latency_millis`, "minimum bandwidth" is
//!   `min_bandwidth` (all three already enforced —
//!   `expiry_millis` by [`crate::requirements::DeliveryRequirements::has_expired`],
//!   `min_bandwidth` by [`crate::scoring::eliminate_hard_constraint_violations`]),
//!   "specific device" is [`crate::types::Destination::Device`]. Zero
//!   new code for this layer.
//! - **network context** (§108's bottom rung, unlabeled in the
//!   diagram but covered by §90/§86): [`crate::discovery::discovery_permitted`]/
//!   [`crate::discovery::DiscoveryBudget`] and
//!   [`crate::acquisition::eliminate_background_restricted`], both
//!   already real, now actually called from one place in the right
//!   order instead of being purely opt-in plumbing a caller might
//!   forget.
//!
//! §113 "Policy Conflict"'s own worked example — large file + no
//! metered + only a metered path exists — is transcribed directly
//! into a test below. The spec's own point ("result: DeferredByPolicy,
//! not silent policy violation") is exactly why [`decide_route`]
//! checks each layer *separately* and returns as soon as one empties
//! a previously non-empty candidate list, instead of running every
//! elimination first and asking only "is anything left" — the former
//! can name *which* layer caused it (§115), the latter can't.
//!
//! §114 "Policy Result Types": [`RouteDecisionResult`], transcribed
//! with its four variants named exactly as listed. §115 "Deferred
//! Reasons": [`DeferredReason`]'s six variants, also transcribed
//! exactly, each wired to a real condition below rather than left as
//! inert enum cases — see [`decide_route`]'s own step-by-step doc
//! comment for which check produces which variant.

///    (nothing to authenticate against, not a policy decision); a

///    false` eliminates [`TransportKind::IrohRelay`]/[`TransportKind::MeshRelay`]
///    candidates; emptying the list here has no single better-fitting
///    §115 reason, so it's [`DeferredReason::NoSuitablePathYet`].
/// 4. **User** (§111): [`crate::privacy::eliminate_privacy_violations`];
///    emptying here uses a fixed priority order over which flag is
///    set (see that logic's own comment, right above [`decide_route`]).
/// 5. **Operation** (§112): [`crate::scoring::eliminate_hard_constraint_violations`];
///    emptying here is [`DeferredReason::NoSuitablePathYet`] — this
///    check covers several independent clauses at once (metered,
///    roaming, allow_dtn/relay/bluetooth, min bandwidth, health), none
///    of which §115 names individually.
/// 6. **Network context**, discovery half (§90): only runs when
///    `discovery_budget` is `Some` and every remaining candidate is
///    [`crate::acquisition::CandidateState::RequiresDiscovery`] — a
///    mixed set just lets scoring/stickiness prefer the
///    already-reachable ones, no elimination needed.
///    [`crate::discovery::discovery_permitted`] returning `false`
///    because of `device.battery_saver` is
///    [`DeferredReason::BatteryPolicy`]; returning `false` for any
///    other reason (thermal, budget exhaustion) is the
///    [`DeferredReason::NoSuitablePathYet`] catch-all — named
///    `BatteryPolicy` specifically because that's the one §115 names,
///    not because thermal/budget causes don't exist.
/// 7. **Network context**, foreground half (§86):
///    [`crate::acquisition::eliminate_background_restricted`];
///    emptying here is [`DeferredReason::BackgroundRestriction`].
/// 8. Whatever survives all seven steps goes to
///    [`crate::plan::plan_route`] for scoring/stickiness/final plan —
///    `Ok` is [`RouteDecisionResult::Routed`]; the `Err` case is a
///    defensive fallback ([`DeferredReason::NoSuitablePathYet`]) that
///    steps 1-7 should already have made unreachable, not a case this
