//! Ties Phase 1's `SiarEndpoint::local_peers()` and Phase 2's
//! `WifiDirectBridge::group_info()` into a shared
//! `siar_domain::ConnectivityState` — the wiring both of those phases'
//! doc comments flagged as missing ("no `apps/android` crate exists yet
//! to own that state").
//!
//! Scoped to exactly the two links those phases actually built
//! introspection for:
//!
//! - **`LocalLan`** — up whenever [`SiarEndpoint::local_peers`] is
//!   non-empty. Works on every platform, since `SiarEndpoint` itself
//!   does.
//! - **`WifiDirect`** (Android only) — up whenever
//!   [`siar_transport_wifi_direct::group_info`] returns `Some`.
//!
//! What's deliberately NOT here:
//!
//! - **Internet** (`InternetDirect`/`InternetRelay`) — `SiarEndpoint`
//!   doesn't expose iroh's own connectivity status as a method yet,
//!   and guessing at what that method would be named or return is
//!   exactly the kind of unverified-against-real-docs risk this
//!   workspace has avoided everywhere else (see `local_discovery.rs`'s
//!   doc comment on why the mDNS API itself was looked up directly
//!   rather than assumed). Real next step, not attempted here.
//! - **Wi-Fi Aware, Bluetooth Classic, BLE** — no crate exists yet with
//!   anything to poll for these. Wi-Fi Aware has no crate at all yet;
//!   BLE's `siar-transport-ble` (Phase 3) built the fragment/reassembly
//!   protocol, and `siar-transport-ble-android` now has the GATT JNI
//!   boundary too, but neither reports a "link is up" style status yet
//!   the way `WifiDirectBridge::group_info` does — BLE's connections
//!   are per-peer (`BleLinkBridge`), not a single radio-wide state, so
//!   "is BLE up" isn't a single yes/no the way the other links are.
//!
//! [`transport_manager`] is this crate's other half: wiring
//! `SiarEndpoint::local_peers()` into a live `siar_routing::PathTable`,
//! not just a `ConnectivityState` boolean.
