//! `GroupService` (plan.md §27–28, §38–39): group membership and group
//! messaging wired onto the transport/crypto that already exist.
//!
//! ## Two group-crypto paths, side by side
//!
//! This module now has **two** independent ways to send/receive group
//! traffic, and deliberately keeps both rather than ripping the first
//! one out:
//!
//! - The **original per-device static-key path**
//!   (`create_group`/`add_member`/`remove_member`/`send_text`/
//!   `handle_incoming_event`) — plan.md §38's *starting point*, "start
//!   with explicit device fanout because its behavior is easier to
//!   reason about." No forward secrecy; removing a member is
//!   bookkeeping only, not cryptographic lockout (see each method's own
//!   doc comment, unchanged from before).
//! - The **new MLS path** (`create_group_mls`/`add_member_mls`/
//!   `remove_member_mls`/`send_text_mls`/`handle_incoming_mls`) —
//!   `siar-crypto-mls`'s `MlsGroupSession`, the real epoch-keyed group
//!   crypto next.md §28 asks for ("Old members must not decrypt future
//!   epochs"). This is what removing a member actually means
//!   cryptographically, not just administratively.
//!
//! Left as a genuinely open question, not decided here: whether/how an
//! existing static-key-path group ever migrates to the MLS path.
//! Nothing in this module attempts that migration — the two paths use
//! different `EnvelopeKind`s (`GroupEvent`/`Text` vs.
//! `GroupMlsCommit`/`GroupMlsWelcome`/`GroupMlsApplication`, see
//! `siar-protocol::v1::EnvelopeKind`'s doc comments) and a
//! `ConversationId` is never implicitly shared between them by this
//! code. A caller picks one path per conversation.
//!
//! ## What the MLS path still doesn't do (flagged, not hidden)
//!
//! - **Still in-memory here, even though a persistent option now
//!   exists upstream.** `siar-crypto-mls` now has
//!   `SqlitePersistentProvider` (real SQLite-backed `OpenMlsProvider`)
//!   and `MlsGroupSession<P>` is generic enough to use it — but this
//!   module's `mls_sessions` map still holds the default, in-memory
//!   `MlsGroupSession<OpenMlsRustCrypto>`, and nothing here constructs
//!   the persistent variant. A process restart still loses every MLS
//!   group's live crypto state; the durable `GroupState`/
//!   `group_members` bookkeeping (`groups` repository) survives, but
//!   the actual key material and epoch does not. Deciding where the
//!   SQLite file lives and how a restarting `GroupService` would
//!   rediscover which conversations to reopen is application-layer
//!   work `siar-crypto-mls` deliberately left unmade — see that
//!   crate's `persistent.rs` doc comment — and it's still unmade here
//!   too, not solved by this bullet's existence.
//! - **Key-package distribution/discovery, partially closed.**
//!   `add_member_mls` still takes bytes as a direct parameter for
//!   out-of-band/testing use, but `key_package_directory.rs`'s
//!   `KeyPackageDirectory` trait plus `publish_key_package`/
//!   `add_member_mls_from_directory` now give a real (if in-memory-only
//!   — see that module's own doc comment) publish/fetch path. Still not
//!   next.md §41–42's full contact-discovery/QR-pairing system — this
//!   only answers "what's this already-known device's key package,"
//!   not "how do I learn about a device in the first place."
