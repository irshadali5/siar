//! siar-messaging: ties storage + crypto + transport together behind one
//! `MessageService` (plan.md §54–55, §111–112's send/receive flows).
//!
//! Same caveat as siar-transport/siar-storage: this depends on both, so it
//! inherits their "needs your local rustc, not this sandbox's" status.
//!
//! Phase-1 scope note: full contact discovery (plan.md §41–42, QR/DHT/
//! username service) doesn't exist yet. `PeerTicket` is the Phase-1
//! stand-in — copy-paste a printed ticket to add a peer — explicitly not
//! meant to survive past Phase 1.

// imports `siar_messaging::InMemoryDeviceDirectory` (main.rs's own
// `use` block), but it was never added to this crate's public
// re-exports, so that import could only ever have resolved if
// something else in the crate re-exported it under a glob — nothing
// does. This was latent until something (this desktop UI work) forced
// an actual compile of the import path.
