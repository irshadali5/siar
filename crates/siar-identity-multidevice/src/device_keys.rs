//! §21 "New Device Key Generation": "The new device generates locally:
//! device signing key, transport key, session/bootstrap material,
//! local database key. Private keys remain local. The existing device
//! signs only the new public identity information."
//!
//! The piece this crate was missing before this round: [`crate::link_key`]
//! generates an *ephemeral* keypair for the linking handshake itself,
//! and [`crate::certificate::DeviceCertificate::issue`] can sign a device's
//! public key into the account — but nothing generated the actual,
//! permanent keys a newly-linked device would go on to use. This
//! module is that step, sitting between the two: a new device runs
//! [`generate_new_device_keys`] once, keeps the result
//! ([`NewDeviceKeys`]) entirely local, and sends only
//! [`NewDeviceKeys::public_keys`]'s output to whoever will call
//! `DeviceCertificate::issue` on it — matching the spec's own "private
//! keys remain local" rule structurally, not just by convention: there
//! is no function anywhere in this module that returns or serializes
//! the private half.
