//! siar-storage: local persistence, backed by stoolap (plan.md §18–20).
//!
//! ============================ NOT YET FULLY VERIFIED =======================
//! First compiled against real `stoolap 0.4.0` source (previously this
//! module doc described stoolap's API from documentation/inference
//! alone, and got two things wrong that a compiler caught): `db.query`
//! returns `Rows`, an iterator of `Result<ResultRow>` — not the raw
//! `Row` type, which is what `ResultRow` wraps internally and has a
//! different (`Option`-returning, not `Result`-returning) `get` method.
//! And `stoolap::Value` has no blob variant at all — `ToParam`/
//! `FromValue` aren't implemented for `Vec<u8>`/`&[u8]`, so every binary
//! payload this crate stores goes in as base64 text via
//! `blob_codec::{encode_blob, decode_blob}` instead. Still not run —
//! `cargo test -p siar-storage` on your machine is the actual check.
//! ============================================================================
//!
//! Also flagged separately: stoolap is days old as a public release. The
//! durability guarantees this crate leans on (plan.md §16–17: "persist
//! before sending", crash-safe outbox) are only as good as stoolap's own
//! WAL/commit correctness, which hasn't had time to be battle-tested.
//! Treat this crate as prototype-grade until stoolap has more mileage.
