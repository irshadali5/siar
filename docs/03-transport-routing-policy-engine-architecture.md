### Round 16 (§151–§159) Summary (2026-09-12)
- **§151 (Route Probability)**: Added `delivery_likelihood` and `expected_delay_class` (`ExpectedDelayClass`) to `PathMetrics` in `metrics.rs` as the typed reception fields for DTN/mesh adapters, avoiding fabricated RTTs. Added `route_probability_signal` in `probability.rs`.
- **§152–§154 (Metric Types, Scoring Normalization, Policy Weights)**: Verified standing design adherence — typed metric categories preserved independently, normalized per-factor suitability terms, and profile-driven float isolation.
- **§155 (Integer Score Option)**: Implemented `PolicyWeights::sum()` in `policy.rs` and `RouteScore::as_fixed_point()` in `scoring.rs`, normalizing scores against actual policy weight sums into the `0..10_000` integer range for deterministic cross-platform portability.
- **§156–§158 (Diagnostics & History Cluster)**: Implemented `diagnostics.rs` with `RouteDecisionLog` (payload-free decision records), `DeveloperDiagnostics` (transcribing the spec's worked example for transport, score, fallback, and `RouteReason::description`), and `RouteHistory` (fixed-capacity ring buffer evicting oldest entries to guarantee bounded retention). Added `primary_score` to `RoutePlan`.
- **§159 (Telemetry Export)**: Implemented `telemetry.rs` with `TelemetrySummary` and `summarize_telemetry`, aggregating route success rate, direct/relay ratio, and failover rate with zero identity fields by construction.

### Round 15 (§140–§150) Summary (2026-09-12)
- **§140 (Bandwidth Reservation)**: Implemented `BandwidthReservation` and `bulk_should_yield_to_reservation` in `resource_pressure.rs`, ensuring Bulk transfers yield unconditionally to active realtime audio/video reservations.
- **§141 (Traffic Shaping)**: Implemented `TrafficShapingPolicy` and `effective_traffic_cap` in `resource_pressure.rs`, enforcing bulk bitrate caps during active calls and background priority caps unconditionally.
- **§142 (Connection Admission)**: Implemented `ConnectionAdmission` and `admission_permitted` in `resource_pressure.rs`, enforcing max total sessions and expensive radio limits while guaranteeing `Priority::Critical` always bypasses admission limits.
- **§143 (Thermal Awareness)**: Implemented `thermal_allows_multipath`, `thermal_allows_transport_setup`, and `thermal_allows_background_bulk` in `resource_pressure.rs`, throttling multi-radio, Wi-Fi Direct setup, and background bulk traffic under `ThermalState::Critical`.
- **§144 (Memory Pressure)**: Added `MemoryPressure` (`Normal`, `Elevated`, `Critical`) to `DeviceState` in `platform.rs`. Implemented `memory_pressure_allows_acquisition` (pausing non-durable bulk while preserving durable transfers) and `recommended_queue_capacity` (scaling queue depth based on memory pressure).
- **§145–§150 (Transport Adapter Contracts)**: Added comprehensive architectural specification in `adapters.rs`, verifying `PathCandidate` fulfills report contracts, confirming zero Iroh-specific API leakage, enforcing `DeviceId` identity over MACs for Bluetooth, and formally documenting transport-layer boundaries for NIC interfaces, BT paired states, Wi-Fi groups, and DTN delivery probability.

### Round 14 (§128–§139) Summary (2026-09-12)
- **§128 & §129 (File Resume & Messaging Retry Integration)**: Documented architectural boundaries — routing coordinates path changes without understanding file chunk state or creating duplicate message semantics.
- **§130 (Call Path Change Integration)**: Implemented `RouteChangeEvent` (`NewPath` and `QualityUpdate` carrying `PathMetrics`) in `engine.rs` to report path switches and metric changes to higher-level call/media engines without performing media actions.
- **§131 (Security Event Integration)**: Implemented `handle_security_event` and `SecurityEvent` in `risk.rs`, immediately invalidating the route cache on authentication failure / revoked device, returning event data for caller candidate eviction and telemetry.
- **§132 (Blacklisting)**: Implemented `PathPenalty` with timestamp-based `until` (guaranteeing penalties expire and transient errors are not permanent) and `eliminate_penalized_paths` in `risk.rs`.
- **§133 (Peer Abuse)**: Implemented `PeerAbuseStatus` (`Quarantined`, `Blocked`) and pre-scoring filter `eliminate_abusive_peers` in `risk.rs` so high-bandwidth abusive peers never survive to compete on scores.
- **§134–§137 (Route Scope & Transport Lists)**: Implemented `RouteScope` (`Any`, `InternetOnly`, `LocalOnly`, `NearbyOnly`), `transport_allowed_in_scope`, and `eliminate_out_of_scope_candidates` in `scope.rs`. Accurately captured spec asymmetry where `LocalOnly` includes `Dtn` while `NearbyOnly` excludes it.
- **§138 (Emergency Override)**: Added `emergency_override_enabled` to `PrivacyPolicy` and `effective_privacy_policy` in `privacy.rs`. Evaluated within `decide_route` Step 4: lifts `avoid_relay` only when both `Priority::Critical` and explicit user opt-in are present.
- **§139 (User Consent)**: Preserved boundary — `PrivacyPolicy` is the concrete policy ingested by routing, while user consent collection is an application/UI layer responsibility.

### Round 13 (§121–§127) Summary (2026-09-12)
- **§121 (Feedback Loop)**: Implemented `health_after_outcome` in `engine.rs` as a pure, stateless single-sample transition updating route health from execution outcomes. Added per-path health tracking in `TestEngine::report_result` with gradual recovery (`Unreachable`/`Suspect` -> `Degraded` -> `Healthy`) and immediate transition to `RouteHealth::Unreachable` on permanent failure classes.
- **§122 (Avoid ML Initially)**: Preserved deterministic weighted-sum routing without ML crates or runtime stochastic dependencies.
- **§123 (Deterministic Scoring)**: Added property tests verifying reproducibility across three distinct architectural layers (`scoring::score`, `plan::plan_route`, `decision::decide_route`) given identical inputs.
- **§124 (Simulated Routing Tests)**: Transcribed spec's exact scenario numbers (Path A: 10ms/1Mbps/metered vs Path B: 50ms/100Mbps/unmetered), proving interactive messages select based on policy while bulk transfers unconditionally require Path B due to hard constraints.
- **§125 (Policy Property Tests)**: Verified all 4 core policy invariants (revoked device exclusion, forbidden metered exclusion, realtime DTN exclusion, expired operation rejection). Added `created_at_millis` to `OperationDescriptor` and `RejectReason::OperationExpired` to `decide_route` Step 0.
- **§126 (Chaos Tests)**: Implemented Wi-Fi flapping test in `plan.rs` simulating 20 consecutive jitter rounds, verifying hysteresis stickiness prevents route storms.
- **§127 (Failover Test)**: Implemented failover simulation proving degraded/unreachable primary immediately fails over to a healthy fallback candidate.

### Round 12 (§116–§120) Summary (2026-09-11)
- **§116 (UI-Friendly State)**: Implemented `RouteUiState` (`Sending`, `WaitingForConnection`, `WaitingForWiFi`, `CarriedByNearbyPeer`, `Delivered`) and `ui_state_for` in `ui_state.rs`, providing a many-to-one collapse of internal decision states to prevent exposing raw transport errors to normal users.
- **§117 (Route Policy Configuration)**: Implemented `RoutingConfig` in `config.rs`, reusing existing types (`RetryPolicy`, `HysteresisPolicy`, boolean gates for relay/bluetooth/dtn/multipath, direct preference default); implemented startup validation (`validate()`) catching inverted retry backoff ranges.
- **§118 (No Global Singleton)**: Verified zero singleton or static state across the crate; routing engine instances are owned explicitly by caller/runtime.
- **§119 (Routing Engine API)**: Implemented native async `RoutingEngine` trait in `engine.rs` with `plan` and `report_result`; implemented `RouteRequest`, `RouteDecision` alias, `RouteResultReport`, and `RouteOutcome` (reusing `RouteFailureClass`); implemented and tested `TestEngine` with a minimal zero-dependency executor.
- **§120 (Transport Manager API)**: Documented architectural boundary — deliberately omitted socket-owning traits/types belonging to lower-level transport crates.

### Round 11 (§108–§115) Summary (2026-09-11)
- **§108 (Policy Layering)**: Implemented `PolicyLayers` bundling system, application, and user policy layers; implemented `decide_route` running the five-layer stack (system → application → user → operation → network context) in sequential order.
- **§109 (System Policy)**: Implemented `SystemPolicy` enforcing hard operation size limit (`max_operation_bytes`) and untrusted device elimination (`security::eliminate_untrusted_candidates`).
- **§110 (Application Policy)**: Implemented `ApplicationPolicy` providing application-level relay control (`allow_relay`).
- **§111 & §112 (User Policy & Operation Policy)**: Integrated `PrivacyPolicy` and `DeliveryRequirements` into the layered decision pipeline.
- **§113 (Policy Conflict)**: Designed layer-by-layer evaluation short-circuiting on the specific conflicting policy layer; verified §113 worked example ("large file + no metered + only metered path exists -> DeferredByPolicy").
- **§114 & §115 (Policy Result Types & Deferred Reasons)**: Implemented `RouteDecisionResult` (`Routed`, `Deferred`, `Rejected`, `Unreachable`), `RejectReason`, and `DeferredReason` (`WaitingForUnmetered`, `WaitingForPeer`, `WaitingForWifi`, `BatteryPolicy`, `BackgroundRestriction`, `NoSuitablePathYet`).

### Round 10 (§105–§107) Summary (2026-09-11)
- **§105 (Path Authorization)**: Implemented `authorize_path` and `eliminate_paths_lacking_authorization` in `authorization.rs` composing the spec's four checks: device active & identity trusted (`security::authorize_candidate`), operation authorized (`DeviceCapabilitySet::contains`), and extension supported (`PeerCapabilities::supports`). Implemented `PathAuthorization` witness struct.
- **§106 (Extension Capability Integration)**: Added `required_extension: Option<ProtocolId>` to `OperationDescriptor`; added peer capability check with conservative failure default (missing capability record treated as unsupported); added `RoutingError::ExtensionNotSupported`.
- **§107 (Device Capability Integration)**: Implemented `select_devices_with_capability` for pre-candidate device selection from a resolved device list; added `DeviceCapabilitySet::REALTIME_MEDIA` to `siar-identity-multidevice`; added `RoutingError::OperationNotAuthorized`.

### Round 9 (§97–§104) Summary (2026-09-10)
- **§97 (Route Decision Explainability)**: Implemented `RouteReason` and `infer_reason` in `explain.rs`; added `reason: RouteReason` to `RoutePlan`.
- **§98 & §99 (Metrics Collection & Privacy of Metrics)**: Implemented `RouteMetricEvent` and `metric_events_for`; verified privacy-by-construction (no peer identity, IP, or location fields).
- **§100 & §101 (Routing State Store & Startup Behavior)**: Implemented `RouteHint`, `hint_from_plan`, and `revalidate_hint` (verifies persisted hint against live healthy candidates).
- **§102 & §103 (Suspend/Resume & Process Death)**: Documented composition of `RouteCache::invalidate_all`, fresh `plan_route`, `RetryPolicy`, and `DiscoveryBudget` for suspend/resume; noted deliberate lack of `Serialize` on `RoutePlan` to prevent stale plan restoration.
- **§104 (Route Plan Lifetime)**: Added `created_at_millis` and `valid_until_millis` to `RoutePlan`, derived from `now_millis` parameter and `policy.hysteresis.minimum_hold_millis`.

### Round 8 (§91–§96) Summary (2026-09-08)
- **§91 & §92 (Route Escalation Ladder & Timeout by Stage)**: Implemented `EscalationStage` (`ActiveConnections`, `KnownEndpoints`, `LightweightDiscovery`, `ExpensiveProximitySetup`, `DtnFallback`) in `resilience.rs`; implemented `escalation_stage_of` by composing `CandidateState`, `SetupCost`, and `TransportKind::Dtn`; implemented `timeout_millis_for_stage` and `should_escalate_beyond`.
- **§93 (Hedged Requests)**: Added `RouteStrategy::Hedged` and `RoutePlan::hedge_delay_millis`; implemented `HedgePolicy` and `hedge_policy_for` (hedges high/critical priority non-bulk, non-delay-tolerant traffic; sets delay to 150ms or 25% of deadline floored at 50ms); integrated into `plan_route`.
- **§94 (Deduplication Requirement)**: Extended `OperationId` documentation to mandate receiver idempotency across `Redundant` and `Hedged` strategies.
- **§95 & §96 (Route Diagnostics & Path Visualization)**: Implemented `RouteDiagnostics`, `RejectionReason`, and `diagnose` in `resilience.rs`; documented §96 Path Visualization as deferred by the spec to Part 18.

### Round 7 (§85–§90) Summary (2026-09-08)
- **§85 & §87 (Battery-Aware Inputs & Platform Policy Integration)**: Implemented `BatteryLevelClass`, `ThermalState`, and `DeviceState` in `platform.rs`; mapped §87's six platform signals across typed fields in the crate.
- **§86 & §89 (Background Restrictions & Candidate Acquisition State)**: Implemented `CandidateState` (`Active`, `PassiveKnown`, `RequiresDiscovery`, `RequiresSetup`) in `acquisition.rs`; added `is_currently_usable` and `eliminate_background_restricted` (with permissive default for unknown foreground state); added `candidate_state` weight across all 7 profiles.
- **§88 & §90 (Path Acquisition & Discovery Budget)**: Implemented `DiscoveryBudget` in `discovery.rs` (sliding-window rate limiting + exhaustion cooldown per `Priority`); implemented `discovery_permitted` combining budget with device safety margins (unconditional block on `ThermalState::Critical`, priority-gated battery saver).
- **Pipeline Integration**: Extended `plan_route` to accept `Option<&DeviceState>` and actively filter background-restricted candidates.

### Round 6 (§75–§84) Summary (2026-09-08)
- **§75–§78 (Multipath Chunk Scheduler, Path Collapse, Duplicate Chunks, Realtime Multipath)**: Documented as out-of-scope for v1 per the spec's own designation as future/optional/advanced.
- **§79 (Congestion Signals)**: Added `CongestionState` (`Normal`, `Congested`, `Severe`), `retransmission_rate`, and `congestion_state` to `PathMetrics`; added `congestion` weight across all 7 `PolicyWeights` profiles; scored in `DefaultScorer`.
- **§80 (Route Stability Score)**: Implemented `derive_stability_score` in `stability.rs` converting lifetime, failure rate, path changes, and timeout count into `StabilityScore`.
- **§81 & §84 (Cold vs Warm Path & Battery Cost)**: Reconciled and documented existing coverage in `setup.rs` (`ConnectionPoolState::Active` -> `SetupCost::Cheap`) and `metrics.rs` (`EnergyCost`).
- **§82 & §83 (Metered Networks & Roaming)**: Refactored `metered` to tri-state `MeteredState` and added `RoamingState`, both conservatively blocking `Unknown` in `passes_hard_constraints`; corrected `file_chunk()` to `allow_metered: false` and added `allow_roaming_bulk: bool`.

### Round 5 (§69–§74) Summary (2026-09-08)
- **§69 & §70 (Route Planning for Messaging & Message Routing Workflow)**: Verified through comprehensive integration tests covering interactive messages, low-power preferences, emergency profiles, and fallback paths.
- **§71 (Message Retry Strategy & Quality Signal)**: Implemented `PathQualitySignal` (`Good`, `Degraded`, `Failed`) in `quality.rs` projected from `PathMetrics` for media/retry adaptation.
- **§72 (Ephemeral Message Routing & Deduplication)**: Documented stable operation ID deduplication in `descriptor.rs` and verified in route planning tests.
- **§73 & §74 (Offline Routing, File Transfers, Path Diversity & Underlay Grouping)**: Implemented `UnderlayId`, `are_diverse`, `group_by_underlay`, and `most_diverse_fallback` in `diversity.rs`; wired into `plan_route`'s redundant-strategy replica selection so redundant copies prefer physically diverse underlays.

### Round 4 (§63–§68) Summary (2026-09-08)
- **§63–§65 (Queue Architecture, Weighted Fair Scheduling, Backpressure)**: Formally documented in `dispatch.rs` via `siar-protocol-ext`'s `FairScheduler` and `BoundedQueue` integration.
- **§66 (Per-Transport Queues)**: Implemented `PerTransportDispatchQueue` in `dispatch.rs` maintaining separate `RouteDispatchQueue` instances per `TransportKind` so a stalled transport (e.g. Bluetooth) cannot block healthy transports (e.g. Iroh).
- **§67 & §68 (Per-Peer & Per-Extension Fairness)**: Implemented generic `RoundRobinFairQueue<K, T>` in `fairness.rs`, instantiated with `DeviceId` for §67 per-peer fairness and `ContentClass` (with newly derived `Hash`) for §68 per-extension fairness.

### Round 3 (§57–§62) Summary (2026-09-08)
- **§57 (Delivery Semantics)**: `typing_indicator()` (non-durable, 5s expiry, no DTN) and `file_chunk()` (durable, bulk, DTN/multipath allowed) constructors on `DeliveryRequirements`.
- **§58 (Operation Descriptor)**: `OperationDescriptor` struct carrying `OperationId`, `Destination`, `DeliveryRequirements`, `ByteCount`, and `ContentClass`.
- **§59 (Content Class)**: 10-variant `ContentClass` enum (Control, Text, Metadata, Thumbnail, Voice, Image, File, RealtimeAudio, RealtimeVideo, Emergency).
- **§60 (Size-Aware Routing)**: `completion_time_millis` combining static transport setup latency with payload byte count and estimated bandwidth (`setup + bytes / bandwidth`).
- **§61 (Deadline-Aware Routing)**: `exceeds_deadline` and `eliminate_deadline_exceeding_candidates` pruning paths that cannot deliver before `max_latency_millis`.
- **§62 (Expiry-Aware Routing)**: `DeliveryRequirements::has_expired` and `RetryPolicy::allows_attempt_at` enforcing clock-based operation expiration during retry attempts.

### Round 2 (§43–§56) Summary (2026-09-08)
- **§43 (Route Re-Evaluation)**: Targeted per-transport cache invalidation (`RouteCache::invalidate_transport`).
- **§44 & §46 (Transport Setup Cost & Connection Pool Integration)**: `SetupCost` and `ConnectionPoolState` modeling static vs pool-adjusted connection setup costs (`static_setup_cost`, `effective_setup_cost`), integrated into `DefaultScorer` as `setup_cost` weight.
- **§45 (Existing Connection Preference)**: `existing_connection` scoring bonus in `DefaultScorer` based on `RoutingContext::current_path`.
- **§47 & §48 (Peer Session Abstraction & Security Constraints)**: `AuthenticatedSession` smart constructor, `authorize_candidate`, and `eliminate_untrusted_candidates` enforcing defense-in-depth re-verification against Part 02's `TrustedAccountStore`.
- **§49 & §50 (Privacy Policy & Direct vs Relay)**: `PrivacyPolicy` struct, `passes_privacy_policy`, `eliminate_privacy_violations`, and `direct_preference_bonus`.
- **§52 (Wi-Fi Direct/Aware Threshold Policy)**: `justifies_expensive_setup` and `eliminate_unjustified_expensive_setup` gating expensive setup on high bitrate, realtime calls, critical priority, or explicit nearby requests.
- **§51, §53, §54, §56**: Fully accounted for via setup costs and `DeliveryRequirements` fields (`nearby_session_explicit`, `dtn_replication_budget`).
- **§55 (Mesh Forwarding)**: Documented as an honest remaining gap (requires richer next-hop/hop-budget representation).

## Implementing crate(s)

- `siar-routing-policy`

- `siar-routing (pre-existing, next.md-era — unreconciled second routing/scoring system, see below)`


## Known gaps / open questions

- Unresolved-by-design reconciliation: two routing/scoring systems — `siar-routing` (next.md-era) vs `siar-routing-policy` (Part 03-era) — documented in the newer crate's own lib.rs, not silently merged.
- §55 Mesh Forwarding: needs dedicated next-hop, route utility, hop budget, and relay trust policy models.


## Note
Detail above reflects implementation through Round 5 (§69–§74) completed on 2026-09-08. Next target: §75 onward.
