//! The `siar_messaging::MessageService` FFI surface
//! `apps/android/README.md` named explicitly as missing: "there is no
//! `siar-messaging::MessageService` FFI surface here at all... This is
//! separate, much larger follow-up work." This crate is that follow-up
//! — deliberately still a *slice* of it, not the whole thing (see
//! "What's still NOT here" below).
//!
//! ## Shape: one global instance, a background pump, a poll queue
//!
//! Same "exactly one, not per-connection" reasoning
//! `siar-android-connectivity`'s own doc comment gives for
//! `ConnectivityState`: there's one `MessageService` for the whole
//! running app, so this is a `static` behind a lock, not a
//! `createBridge`/handle pattern like the four transport bridges use.
//!
//! JNI is call-in only in this whole app (every `jni_bridge.rs`'s own
//! doc comment states this rule) — Rust has no way to push an incoming
//! message to Kotlin the instant it arrives. So a background task
//! (spawned once, in [`bootstrap`]) drains `MessageService`'s incoming
//! frames continuously and appends a plain-text summary line to an
//! in-memory queue; [`poll_next_event`] is what Kotlin calls
//! (repeatedly, e.g. on its own timer — same tradeoff
//! [`com.siar.ble.BleGattManager`]'s fragment pump already documents
//! for the identical shape) to drain it one line at a time.
//!
//! ## Event line format
//!
//! Deliberately plain tab-separated text, not JSON — this workspace has
//! no `serde_json` dependency anywhere (checked: `siar-crypto-mls`'s own
//! Cargo.toml has a comment explaining why it deliberately avoided
//! adding one), and inventing a second serialization format across the
//! JNI boundary for a handful of fixed-shape lines is real, avoidable
//! overhead for both sides — Kotlin can `split("\t")` a fixed number of
//! fields without a JSON parser dependency of its own. Two event kinds
//! today:
//! - `text\t<sender endpoint id hex>\t<message text>`
//! - `mailbox\t<count>` — a `MailboxCheckIn` response batch finished
//!   arriving (matches `apps/cli`'s own `check_mailbox`'s "count and
//!   move on" shape; individual mailbox item contents aren't
//!   surfaced by this crate yet — see below).
//! - `anon_text\t<matched peer's endpoint id hex>\t<message text>` — a
//!   `TokenMailboxDeposit` that decrypted successfully against one of
//!   this process's registered peers. The "sender" here is *inferred*
//!   (which candidate's session key actually opened it), not read off
//!   the wire — an anonymous check-in response has no sender field at
//!   all, the entire point (see `siar_crypto::mailbox_token`'s doc
//!   comment).
//! - `attachment\t<sender endpoint id debug>\t<blob_hash b64>\t<size
//!   bytes>\t<media type>\t<attachment_key b64>` — a 1:1
//!   `MessageContent::Attachment` arrived; [`fetch_attachment`] needs
//!   every one of these fields back to actually retrieve the blob.
//! - `group_invite\t<conversation id>\t<from device debug>` — a
//!   `GroupMlsWelcome` arrived and is buffered, waiting on
//!   [`group_join`]/[`group_decline_invite`].
//! - `group_text\t<conversation id>\t<sender device debug>\t<message
//!   text>` — a `GroupMlsApplication` frame decoded to text.
//!
//! ## What's here
//!
//! - [`bootstrap`] — generates a fresh identity (no persistence across
//!   app restarts yet, same Phase-1 stand-in `apps/cli`'s own
//!   `bootstrap()` doc comment already carries), binds a
//!   `SiarEndpoint`, starts the incoming-event pump, and reports
//!   `TransportLink::InternetDirect` up into `siar-android-
//!   connectivity`'s shared `ConnectivityState` once the bind
//!   succeeds (no corresponding "mark it down" anywhere in this crate
//!   yet — see [`bootstrap`]'s own inline comment).
//! - [`my_ticket`] — this device's own `PeerTicket`, encoded, to
//!   display/share (e.g. as a QR code — not built here, just the
//!   string it would encode).
//! - [`add_peer`] — registers a peer's ticket so incoming `V1`
//!   envelopes from them can actually be decrypted (`MessageService::
//!   handle_incoming` needs the sender's `PeerTicket` up front — see
//!   that method's own doc comment: "Phase 1's CLI trusts that `peer`
//!   really is who the transport says it is... paired by hand," the
//!   exact same precondition this crate inherits unchanged). Also
//!   what lets an incoming `TokenMailboxDeposit` be matched to a
//!   sender — see the `anon_text` event kind above.
//! - [`send_text`]/[`send_text_anon`] — the `DeviceId`-addressed and
//!   unlinkable-token-addressed paths respectively
//!   (`MessageService::send_text`/`send_text_anon`), mirroring
//!   `apps/cli`'s `send`/`send-anon`.
//! - [`check_mailbox`]/[`check_mailbox_anon`] — fire a
//!   `MailboxCheckIn`/`AnonymousMailboxCheckIn` at a relay; responses
//!   land in the poll queue as `mailbox\t<count>`/`anon_text\t...`
//!   respectively, mirroring `apps/cli`'s `check-mailbox`/
//!   `check-mailbox-anon`.
//! - **Groups/MLS** — `GroupService` is now wired in, mirroring
//!   `apps/desktop`'s own `bootstrap_messaging`/`incoming_loop` wiring
//!   (the reference this crate's group functions were built against)
//!   rather than `apps/cli`'s one-shot-process version, since a
//!   long-running Android process can match the desktop app's
//!   always-listening shape instead of needing the CLI's manual
//!   `listen --publish-key-package` workaround for
//!   `pending_identity`'s in-process-only lifetime. A key package is
//!   published once automatically at [`bootstrap`] time (same as
//!   desktop) — [`group_key_package`] returns the resulting base64
//!   text to share out-of-band with whoever will add this device to a
//!   group, exactly the same hand-paired exchange `PeerTicket` itself
//!   already requires (see this crate's own top doc comment on that).
//!   [`group_create`]/[`group_add_member`]/[`group_send_text`]/
//!   [`group_join`]/[`group_decline_invite`] are the rest of the
//!   surface; an incoming `GroupMlsWelcome` is buffered (not
//!   auto-joined — same deliberate "let the UI ask first" stance
//!   `GroupService::handle_incoming_mls`'s own doc comment states) and
//!   surfaces as a `group_invite\t...` poll event, `GroupMlsApplication`
//!   text as `group_text\t...`. **Not attempted**: `add_member`/
//!   `remove_member` (the static-key, non-MLS group path —
//!   `create_group_mls`'s MLS path is the real cryptographic one, same
//!   choice `apps/cli`/`apps/desktop` both made), `remove_member_mls`,
//!   and group attachments (`handle_incoming_mls` can hand back
//!   `MessageContent::Attachment` in principle, but fetching it needs
//!   the sending device's `PeerTicket`, and `envelope.sender` is only
//!   a bare `DeviceId` with no directory lookup back to one exposed
//!   anywhere in this codebase yet, in `apps/desktop` either — a real
//!   gap in the library this crate wraps, not something to paper over
//!   here).
//! - **Attachments (1:1 only)** — [`send_attachment`]/
//!   [`fetch_attachment`] wrap `MessageService::send_attachment`/
//!   `fetch_attachment` directly (both already take/return plain
//!   `Vec<u8>`, so unlike groups there's no out-of-band exchange
//!   needed here — the reference and the blob both travel over the
//!   wire on their own). An incoming `MessageContent::Attachment`
//!   surfaces as `attachment\t...` in the poll queue, carrying the
//!   `AttachmentReference` fields [`fetch_attachment`] needs back.
//!   Deliberately no image decoding/thumbnailing here (unlike
//!   `apps/desktop`'s `siar-media-image`-backed preview pipeline) —
//!   Android already prefers platform codecs over this workspace's own
//!   native ones (see `build-native.sh`'s own comment on why
//!   `siar-media-audio`/`siar-media-av1` are desktop-only), and
//!   `BitmapFactory` on the Kotlin side is the equivalent tool for
//!   images specifically, not a new native dependency here.
//!
//! ## What's still NOT here
//!
//! - **No delivery-ack visibility.** Incoming `DeliveryAck`/
//!   `ReadReceipt` frames are silently absorbed by `handle_incoming`
//!   (returns `None` for them, same as `apps/cli`) — nothing surfaces
//!   "your message was delivered" to Kotlin.
//! - **Individual mailbox item contents aren't surfaced.** `check_mailbox`
//!   reports a count, not each `Mesh` envelope's ciphertext/metadata —
//!   `apps/cli`'s `check_mailbox` shows byte length/hop_limit/priority
//!   per item; this crate's poll-queue line format doesn't have room
//!   for that yet without designing a richer event line (or, more
//!   likely, finally justifying a real serialization format — noted,
//!   not decided here).
//! - **Identity/database now persist across restarts.** `bootstrap`
//!   takes a `base_dir` (Kotlin passes `Context.filesDir`) and
//!   load-or-creates `DeviceIdentity`/`DeviceId`/`AccountId` there via
//!   `DeviceIdentity::save_to_file`/`load_from_file` (already-existing
//!   primitives, previously with no Android caller) plus two bare-UUID
//!   text files, and opens a real on-disk database (`siar_storage::open`)
//!   instead of `open_in_memory()` — the exact pattern `apps/desktop`'s
//!   own `resolve_data_paths`/`load_or_create_id` already used,
//!   applied here for the first time, and later mirrored into
//!   `apps/cli` too (see that binary's own `resolve_data_paths`/
//!   `load_or_create_id`) — all three of this workspace's client
//!   entry points now persist identity the same way.
//! - **`mark_link_up` now has a real `mark_link_down` counterpart** —
//!   [`shutdown_inner`], called (via JNI) from `MainActivity.onDestroy`.
//!   `APP` moved from a `OnceLock` to `Mutex<Option<Arc<AppMessaging>>>`
//!   specifically so this could stop the pump task
//!   (`JoinHandle::abort`) and let the bound endpoint drop for real,
//!   instead of only updating connectivity state — see
//!   [`shutdown_inner`]'s own doc comment for the one remaining
//!   caveat (abort isn't synchronous).

// Everything below `AppMessaging` through `poll_next_event_inner` is
// only ever called from `jni_bridge`, which is `#[cfg(target_os =
// "android")]` — on a host `cargo check`/`cargo test` (this crate's
// `rlib` output, not its `cdylib`), that whole module drops out and
// every one of these becomes unreachable dead code by the compiler's
// reckoning, despite being real, exercised logic on the platform this
// crate actually ships on. Same reasoning, same fix shape,
// `siar-android-connectivity::link_from_ordinal`'s own `cfg_attr`
// already uses — applied once here at module scope instead of item by
// item, since nearly everything in this file shares the exact same
// android-only-caller situation.
