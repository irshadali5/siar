//! Siar desktop shell (plan.md §52, §126: Phase 3 — Dioxus on top of the
//! existing messaging core, nothing else changes underneath it).
//!
//! ============================ NOT YET VERIFIED ============================
//! Written against Dioxus 0.7's documented component model (`#[component]`,
//! `rsx!`, `use_signal`, `spawn`, `dioxus::desktop::launch`). Unlike
//! `iroh`/`stoolap`, this isn't just a rustc-version gap — Dioxus desktop
//! needs a system webview (webkit2gtk on Linux) that this sandbox doesn't
//! have installed at all, so there was no path to verifying this even at
//! the "does it parse" level the way source-reading unblocked
//! `siar-transport`. Treat this file as a first draft to build against,
//! not a compiled artifact.
//! ============================================================================
//!
//! Architecture (plan.md §52–55): Dioxus components never call
//! `MessageService` directly. They read `AppState`'s signals and send
//! `AppCommand`s down `command_tx`; a background Tokio task owns the
//! actual `MessageService` and pushes results back by mutating those same
//! signals. That's what keeps `siar-messaging`/`siar-transport` out of
//! the component code in `components.rs`.
